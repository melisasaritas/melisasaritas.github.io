Attacktive Directory â€“ TryHackMe

Active Directory (AD) is a crucial component in Windows-based networks, providing authentication, security policies, and access control through a centralized domain controller. This write-up focuses on solving the Attactive Directory machine, which involves exploiting Active Directory vulnerabilities to gain privileged access.

The solution follows a structured approach, including reconnaissance, user enumeration, Kerberos abuse, folder discovery, and privilege escalation. Each step is carried out systematically using specialized tools to analyze and exploit security flaws effectively.

For a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the solution, refer to the attached PDF file:
