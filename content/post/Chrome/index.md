Chrome â€“ TryHackMe

Google Chrome stores user credentials securely using the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI), which relies on a master key tied to the userâ€™s Windows credentials. This write-up focuses on solving the Chrome machine, which involves extracting and decrypting Chrome-stored credentials from a collection of provided files.

The approach includes analyzing captured network traffic, decompiling a .NET executable, decrypting AES-encrypted files, cracking the DPAPI password, and ultimately retrieving saved login credentials from Chromeâ€™s database.

Each phase is executed using tools like Wireshark, ILSpy, CyberChef, and pypykatz, offering hands-on experience with credential recovery and browser forensics.
