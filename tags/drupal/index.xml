&lt;p>DC-1 is a beginner-friendly vulnerable machine hosted on VulnHub, featuring a web application running on an outdated version of Drupal, a popular content management system. The goal is to exploit the CMS and ultimately gain root access by progressing through multiple phases of attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process begins with scanning the network to identify open services such as SSH, HTTP, and RPC. Once the target is mapped, exploitation is carried out using a known vulnerabilityâ€”CVE-2018-7600, also known as Drupalgeddon2â€”through the Metasploit framework. Upon successful exploitation, a reverse shell is established and upgraded for better interactivity. The final stage involves privilege escalation by leveraging a misconfigured SUID binary to obtain root-level access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each phase is executed using tools like netdiscover, nmap, Metasploit, and native Linux commands, providing a realistic and hands-on experience with common offensive security techniques such as network enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation.&lt;/p>
